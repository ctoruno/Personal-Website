In [my last post](https://www.carlos-toruno.com/blog/clustering-public-opinion/00-intro/), I talked about a recent exercise that I performed in order to group people into clusters according to their opinions and perceptions regarding the state of the Rule of Law, Justice, and Governance in their countries and/or local regions. Due to the nature of the data, we will have to face the decision of what to do with the missing values that we have in our data set. And that... might not be an easy task.

The data I'm working with comes from a survey applied to the general public and has two important features. First, all questions I'm focusing on in this exercise offered the possibility to either refused to answer or say "Don't know", which is a completely valid answer. Second, all questions are measured as Liker scales, which is a specific form of ordinal data. As mentioned in the previous post, ordinal data has specific traits that makes the typical assumptions of linearity and normality to be invalid. These assumptions are very common for most data imputations out there. Therefore, you need to be very careful on which methods you are using to impute your data when facing ordinal data like I am right now.

There are a few options for you to choose when dealing with ordinal data, but the one I will be working on right now is a method called Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE). In this post, I will be providing a step-by-step guide on how to perform this method in R on an example data set.

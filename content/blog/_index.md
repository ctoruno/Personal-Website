  description: "Gallo Pinto is one of the most emblematic food dishes in Nicaragua.
  It  consists in a mixed of rice and beans. For Nicaraguans like me, it also refers to
  a mix of different and sometimes opposite things.\n\n
  This blog is basically that, a repository where I will try to write down some of my
  quite diverse thoughts. Random Walk in action."

** No content below YAML for the blog _index. This file provides front matter for the listing page layout and sidebar content. It is also a branch bundle, and all settings under `cascade` provide front matter for all pages inside blog/. You may still override any of these by changing them in a page's front matter.**

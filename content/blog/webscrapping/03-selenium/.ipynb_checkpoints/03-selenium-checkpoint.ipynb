    "In my [previous post](https://www.carlos-toruno.com/blog/webscrapping/02-requests/) about webscrapping with Python, I talked a bit about how to use the [Requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [Beautiful Soup library](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) libraries in order to extract the information from the web and we applied these tools to gather information from the [Polish National Registry of Lawyers](https://rejestradwokatow.pl/adwokat). However, requests might fall short when we have to extract information from dynamically generated content that use internal APIs or JavaScript to display the information. Under this scenario, we need to expand our set of tools in order to overcome these obstacles. One of such alternatives is to use a web driver. Therefore, in this post, I will be explainign how to use a web driver to locate HTML elements in a website and I will use it to extract lawyers information from [The German Lawyers' Association](https://anwaltauskunft.de/magazin).\n",

    "## What's a web driver?\n",
    "According to the [W3C Advisory Committee](https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver/):\n",
    "\n",
    "> A WebDriver is a remote control interface that enables introspection and control of user agents. It provides a platform- and language-neutral wire protocol as a way for out-of-process programs to remotely instruct the behavior of web browsers.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, a web driver allows you to remotely control a web browser. Because of this, these tools are mainly use to run local tests when you are developing a website. However, due to its characteristics, it can also be used to perform webscraping because it allows you to control or program the behavior of a web browser through coding. Nowadays, the most popular WebDriver out there is undoubtly the [Selenium Project](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/). For this post, we will be using the [Selenium Python Library](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/index.html) to extract the information we want. If you want to learn more about WebDrivers and Selenium, I would suggest you to watch the following video:\n",
    "\n",
    "<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/unu7R9DU-eU\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n",
    "\n",
    "## The problem at hand\n",
    "As mentioned before, the request library might fall short when dealing with dynamic websites. As we did in the [previous exercise](https://www.carlos-toruno.com/blog/webscrapping/02-requests/) with Poland, this time I would like to gather information related to the geographical distribution, the different law specializations and contact information of german lawyers. For this, I will be scraping information from [The German Lawyers' Association website](https://anwaltauskunft.de/anwaltssuche).\n",
    "\n",
    "As we can observe, right from the beginning we get a list of 58,648 lawyers that are listed in 5,865 pages of results that display a summary of 10 lawyers each. Nevertheless, this summary is not enough and we would have to go to the individual pages that contain the full information for each lawyer. To achieve this, we could easily extract the information using the **request** and **BeautifulSoup** libraries to loop across all the pages of result and fetch the URLs of the individual pages. Then, once that we have a list with all 58 thousand links, we could loop across each of these URLs and retrieve all the information we are interested in.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if we take a look at how results are sorted, we can observe that, by default, the lawyers are listed **randomly**. This means that, the order in which lawyers are displayed migh change every time that we request the source code. That being the case, even if we loop through all 5,865 pages of results, we might end up skipping some lawyers because of the randomness in which results are showed and even webscraping the same lawyer several times. Take a look at the following two images for example, both of them show the lawyers that are at the end of page number 25. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"randomness.png\" width=\"100%\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "As we can observe, lawyers are completely different people. In order to get all the information we want, we would need to click on the dropdown list that we have above the list of results and select **Sort Results: Alphabetically** (_Ergebnisse sortieren: Zufall_). This way, we would ensure that we don't get duplicates nor that we skip lawyers while looping across the pages of results.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"dropdown.png\" width=\"100%\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Once that we select the alphabetical sorting in the dropdown list, we can observe that the URL is still `https://anwaltauskunft.de/anwaltssuche?page=1`, but now, the results are sorted in alphabetical order. This is because the search results are generated dynamically through JavaScript functions. Given that the URL is not altered, the **request** library is of no help in this scenario. We need a tool that allow us to emulate the behavior of a web browser. For this same reason, I will be using **Selenium** for the crawling and, once I have fetched all individual URLs, we can perform the webscraping using the tools we know until now.\n"

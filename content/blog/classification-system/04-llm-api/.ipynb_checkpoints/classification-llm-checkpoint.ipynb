    "In my [previous blog post](https://www.carlos-toruno.com/blog/classification-system/03-using-chat-gpt-as-classifier/), I talked about Large Language Models (LLMs) and how you can use them to perform some specific tasks as long as you put special attention at how you are pharing your instructions to the model. However, we did all this using ChatGPT, which, technically speaking, is an app not a LLM. If you want to incorporate the power of LLMs into your own programming workflow you will have to access them through their official API. In this blog post I will go step by step on how to incorporate the power of GPT and Gemini models to your own framework in order to solve specific tasks.\n",

    "The task at hand will be very easy. First, we want to classify news articles into two groups: those related to the Rule of Law, and those unrelated to the Rule of Law. Second, for those articles that are related to the Rule of Law, we want to see how related they are to each on of the pillars of the Rule of Law. If you are a bit lost or feel unfamiliar with the theoretical framework, don't worry... so is the model. Therefore, I will be providing context along the road.\n",

    "I will be working with a subset of news articles from European newspapers that we donloaded using a News API. For more information on how we were able to get this data, you can check [this blog post](https://www.carlos-toruno.com/blog/classification-system/01-gathering-data/). We begin by reading our data using the [Pandas Python Library](https://pandas.pydata.org/) as follows:"

    "# Key macro concepts\n",
    "Here are the definitions of Rule of Law, Justice, and Governance:\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is the Rule of Law?\n",
    "The term Rule of Law refers to a system in which law is able to impose meaningful restraints on the state and individual \n",
    "members of the ruling elite. It refers to a governance principle in which all persons, institutions, and entities, public \n",
    "and private, including the State itself, are accountable to laws that are publicly promulgated, equally enforced, and \n",
    "independently adjudicated, and which are consistent with international human rights norms and standards.\n",
    "\n",
    "We extend this concept further by defining the Rule of Law as a rules-based system in which the following four universal \n",
    "principles are upheld. First, the government and its officials and agents are accountable under the law. Second, the laws \n",
    "are clear, publicized, stable, and fair, and protect fundamental rights, including the security of persons and property. \n",
    "Third, the process by which the laws are enacted, administered, and enforced is accessible, fair, and efficient. Lastly, \n",
    "access to justice is provided by competent, independent, and ethical adjudicators, attorneys or representatives, and \n",
    "judicial officers who are of sufficient number, have adequate resources, and reflect the makeup of the communities they serve.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the previous definitions, we can infer that the Rule of Law is a multidimensional concept that extends over eight \n",
    "basic pillars: limited government powers; absence of corruption; order and security; fundamental rights; open government; \n",
    "effective regulatory enforcement; access to civil justice; and an effective criminal justice.\n",
    "\n",
    "From a political science perspective, these factors draw on four basic ideas related to the relationship between the state \n",
    "and the civil society: the checks and balances on the government's power, the effectiveness of the state in performing its \n",
    "basic functions, participation and collaboration between the state and its citizens, and absence of arbitrary abuse by the \n",
    "authority.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Justice?\n",
    "We define Justice as the ethical, philosophical idea that people are to be treated impartially, fairly, properly, \n",
    "and reasonably by the law and by arbiters of the law, that laws are to ensure that no harm befalls another, and that, \n",
    "where harm is alleged, a remedial action is taken - both the accuser and the accused receive a morally right \n",
    "consequence merited by their actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Justice also refers more specifically to the set of institutions and services that allow for the impartial mediation \n",
    "and adjudication of disputes arising from the violation or conflicting interpretations of laws, including the enforcement \n",
    "of decisions or agreements reached through their operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Governance?\n",
    "Finally, we define Governance as the mechanisms, processes, and structures through which public institutions operate and \n",
    "make decisions for the welfare and benefit of their respective communities. This encompasses the way governments and local \n",
    "authorities are organized, how policies are formulated and implemented, how resources are allocated and managed, and how \n",

    "    Measures the extent to which those who govern are bound by law. It comprises the means, both constitutional and institutional, by which the powers of the \n",
    "    government and its officials and agents are limited and held accountable under the law. It also includes non-governmental checks on the government’s power, \n",
    "    such as a free and independent press. Additionally, it measures the absence of authoritarianism, which includes the accountability of the Chief Executive, \n",
    "    and its respect for checks and balances.\n",
    "\n",
    "    In more detail, this pillar is related to the following topics:\n",
    "    -\tThe active and reactive transparency of legislative bodies (senate, parliament, assemblies), its ability to impose disciplinary measures to government \n",
    "    officials, and if there is representation of disadvantaged groups, as well as citizen participation. It also measures if the opposition can express its \n",
    "    opinions and if it exercises its functions of overseeing and investigating the government.\n",
    "    -\tThe independence of the judiciary, by means of having sufficient resources and professional judges, with adequate rights and competencies, as well as \n",
    "    its ability to impose disciplinary measures on government officials.\n",
    "    -\tThe independence and effectiveness of oversight institutions, such as the Supreme Audit Institution or comptroller, anticorruption authority, human rights \n",
    "    institution, the office of the ombudsman, and prosecution services, as well as if civil servants are free from political pressure, and are effective in implementing \n",
    "    public policies.\n",
    "    -\tWhether elections are free of barriers of entry, intimidation, corruption, and criminality, in accordance with the law, with equitable access to resources, \n",
    "    free from misinformation, secure from cyberattacks and with protection of personal. It also measures the effectiveness and independence of the electoral authority.\n",
    "    -\tThe effectiveness of non-governmental checks on the government’s power, such as the media, CSOs, political parties, activists, and citizens. It includes their \n",
    "    effective exercise of the freedoms of assembly, association, opinion, and expression, and the rights to petition and civic engagement.\n",
    "    -\tThe accountability of the Chief Executive or the Head of Government, and its respect for the constitutional order, the law-making process, the outcome and quality \n",
    "    of elections, civil liberties, political opponents, as well as the independence of the judiciary and oversight institutions. It also measures the likelihood of \n",
    "    sanctions to officials for misconduct.\n",
    "    -\tWhether members of the legislature, judiciary, elected leaders or high-ranking government officials, public sector employees, and police officers, who abuse their \n",
    "    power are sanctioned for misconduct.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Constraints on Government Powers:\n",
    "Measures the control of corruption in various forms: bribery in administrative and political proceedings, graft, embezzlement, fraud, payroll fraud, asset misappropriation \n",
    "and skimming, nepotism, favoritism, patronage, illegal campaign financing, electoral fraud and vote buying.\n",
    "\n",
    "In more detail, this pillar is related to the following topics:\n",
    "    -\tThe prevalence of bribery in the delivery of public services and regulations, as well as in the political process. \n",
    "    -\tThe prevalence of graft by elected officials, public sector employees, by awarding contracts without competitive bidding processes, exerting influence for their \n",
    "    private benefit, and using insider knowledge to profit.\n",

In other words, accessing the model in a programmatically way. In other words, instead of running the code individually for each article, having access to the API allow us to set up a workflow to process a whole data file. \n",

    "You can now try playing and process/generate data with Large Language Models by extending these examples on your own data project. As I mentioned in my previous post, there are hundreds of LLMs available for you to play out there. Some of them have their own python library available. In this situation, where setting up workflows with different providers can easily become chaotic, you need to worry. The [Langchain framework](https://www.langchain.com/) comes in handy for this. Langchain is a framework for developing applications powered by language models. It provides tools for connecting your application with different models, managing prompt templates, parsening outcomes, among many other features. In a future blog post, I will elaborate a bit more on the basic use of this framework to facilitate many of the steps we implemented in this example. Until then, farewell my dear three readers."

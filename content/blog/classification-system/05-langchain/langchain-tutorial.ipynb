    "My dear three readers, I know I have been off for a whole month now and I feel terrible. Things have been really crazy at work lately. However, I found some time this weekend and I wanted to continue with my series on using AI to setup a gathering and classification system that is able to massively track and organize events that can provide insights on the state of the Rule of Law in a country. Until now, I have talked about how to gather news articles using a News API and how to classify them using AI, which is a topic that I left open back in January.\n",
    "\n",
    "In my [previous blog post](https://www.carlos-toruno.com/blog/classification-system/04-llm-api/), I briefly mentioned [Langchain](https://www.langchain.com/langchain) and why it is a must-known framework if you are planning on working with Large Language Models. Retaking that conversation, Langchain is an open-source framework that facilitates the integration of generative AI models into your own framework. You can see it as a toolkit that covers and provide easy and fast solutions to many of the usual tasks that programmers face when dealing with language models. Langchain provides a whole set of features that makes your life easier. In this post, I'm just going to explain the basic features and how to integrate this amazing tool into our news classification exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"featured.jpg\" width=\"100%\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "## How does it work?\n",
    "Langchain was built following a modular architecture. This means that you can easily call and use different components depending on your needs. The framework provides separate libraries for selectors, model wrappers, prompt managing, output parsers, text splittling, API interaction, among many others. You can think of Langchain as a Swiss Army Knife that comes with multiple blades and tools that you can use independently depending on how are you planning to interact with the language model.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the same time, Langchain also allows you to streamline the process by constructing \"_chains_\". These chains are sequences of steps that process information, pass it to a language model, and ultimately generate an output. By programming these sequences or \"_chains_\", you can pre-program the process in order to have an assembly line ready for use.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, going back to [our news classification exercise](https://www.carlos-toruno.com/blog/classification-system/04-llm-api/), we needed to customize a prompt template, send a call to a language model, and then parse the received output. These three steps can be easily streamlined using Langchain. As I said before, in this post I will just touch base over some basic functionalities. However, if you would like a more indepth explanation of Langchain, I would suggest you to watch this video from Rabbitmetrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/aywZrzNaKjs?si=qU0M4iE2CaeK3hVV\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, I would also suggest you to read the official documentation publicly available in [this website](https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started/introduction).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Required libraries\n",
    "At this point, is more than clear that we need to install Langchain in order to use it. We can proceed by installing the official python release version by running the following line in our terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "pip install langchain\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For this exercise, we will be using Google's Gemini model that was released on December, 2023. Therefore, we will also need to install the official [Python Software Development Kit from Google](https://ai.google.dev/tutorials/python_quickstart?_gl=1*1tz497e*_up*MQ..&gclid=CjwKCAiA3JCvBhA8EiwA4kujZjdXHbaRefWLu6WwPprj53XzQmUhuFAsITSrePIowuDG6-4Jb41WbxoC5a8QAvD_BwE#setup) and the [Google AI module from Langchain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/chat/google_generative_ai). Following the official documentation from both developers, we can install these by running the following lines in our terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "pip install -q -U google-generativeai\n",
    "pip install --upgrade --quiet  langchain-google-genai pillow\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have all the required libraries installed, we can proceed to import the modules we will be using in this tutorial. Most of these modules and libraries are already known by my three usual readers. Therefore, I'm just going to highlight three:\n",
    "- The `ChatPromptTemplate` is a module that allows us to manage prompt templates.\n",
    "- The `ChatGoogleGenerativeAI` is a wrapper that allows you to send calls or invoke the Gemini language model in a standardized fashion.\n",
    "- The `BaseOutputParser` is a module that allow us to easily parse outputs received from language models."

As a summary, we will be doing a classification exercise in which we ask the Gemini model to read a news article and classify it in two groups: (i) articles that are related to our Rule of Law, Justice, and Governance framework, and (ii) those that are unrelated. Once that we have identified which articles are related to the Rule of Law, Justice, and Governance, we ask Gemini to provide a score telling us how closely related is the article to each one of the eight pillars of our framework: Constraints to Government Powers, Abscense of Corruption, Open Government, Fundamental Freedoms, Order and Security, Regulatory Enforcement, Civil Justice, and Criminal Justice. For that reason, we will be referring to each one of these classification rounds as _stage 1_ and _stage 2_, respectively. For each one of these stages, we will be passing a _context_ and an _instructions_ prompt. You can go over these prompts by clicking on the URLs bellow:\n",

    "You can open these prompt templates and see how they are trying to provide an accurate context and instructions to the model. Similarly, they provide a very extensive explanation of our theoretical framework so the model output fits our needs as best as possible. Our target is to pass this context every time that we ask Gemini to read an article, this is why we treat these as **templates**. If you open any of the instructions prompt templates, you will see that they include the following chunk of text:\n",
    "\n",
    "> _Now, given the following news article:_<br>\n",
    "> _News title: {headline}_<br>\n",
    "> _News summary: {summary}_<br>\n",
    "> _News body: {body}_<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Everytime that we send a news article to Gemini, we have to replace the `{headline}`, `{summary}`, and `{body}` parts of the template with the actual headline, summary, and content that we have in our `master_data`. **It is very important that the .txt file that we are reading contain the \"_replaceable_\" parts within curly brackets in order for the prompt managing tools from Langchain to work as expected**. In my previous post, we were doing this using the `format()` method for strings in Python. However, Langchain provides a similar tool for managing and customizing prompts through the `ChatPromptTemplate` module. We can define our context template as a **_System Role_** message, and our instructions template as a **_Human Role_** using the `from_messages()` method. To understand how role management works in text generation models, you can check [this page](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text-generation/chat-completions-api) from the OpenAI's official documentation. For our _stage 1_ exercise, we could define the prompt template as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "stage_1_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([\n",
    "                (\"system\", context_stage_1),\n",
    "                (\"human\", instructions_stage_1),\n",
    "            ])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This way, Langchain will understand that there are parts that will need to be replaced in the prompt text before passing it to the model. We will tell Langchain how to replace these values when invoking the model. For now, it is fine just having a final prompt with the roles properly assigned. This is the first step in our \"_chain_\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Once that we have our prompt template defined, we can think on our second step, which is sending the customize prompt to Gemini. For this, Langchain offers a wide set of wrappers that makes it super easy to send calls to a large variety of Large Language Models. In this exercise, we will be using the `ChatGoogleGenerativeAI` wrapper to send our calls:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "ChatGoogleGenerativeAI(model = \"gemini-pro\",\n",
    "                       temperature     = 0.2, \n",
    "                       safety_settings = safety_settings,\n",
    "                       convert_system_message_to_human = True)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For our calls, we are defining that we would like to use the `gemini-pro` model with a temperature parameter of 0.15. The temperature parameter is used to control the _randomness_ or _creativity_  of the output. A low temperature will prioritize the next words in its prediction, while a high temperature will consider \"less likely\" options in the prediction. Given that we want the model to work under \"_factual accuracy_\", we pass a low temperature parameter. Moreover, given that Gemini does not support the \"System Role\" in its syntax, we activate the `convert_system_message_to_human` parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that, by default, Gemini comes with some medium-high safety settings that could block a prompt to be answered by the model, we would like to reduce how strict these settings are. For this, we define a new set of safety nets as follows:"

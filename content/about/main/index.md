  # About me
  
  Iâ€™m a young economist from Nicaragua with experience as a researcher in development topics. I describe myself as a very organized and pro-active person with high performance in team working, but also as a curious individual with a high level of critical thinking. 
  
  These characteristics have allowed me to integrate, quickly and easily, into a new professional environment without for getting that we are in a continuous learning process. My main topics of interest are policy design and evaluation, poverty, inequality, democracy, rule of law and governance.
